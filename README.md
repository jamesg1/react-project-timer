### React Project Timer App

This is a small example React application where users can run timers on study projects. The status of the timers are written to a JSON file through node API endpoints. This is part of my [Full Stack React study](https://www.fullstackreact.com/).

### Running the app

1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.

Follow the instructions for your platform [here](https://github.com/npm/npm).

2. Install all dependencies:

````
npm install
````

3. Boot the HTTP server

````
npm run server
````

The server is now running at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)
